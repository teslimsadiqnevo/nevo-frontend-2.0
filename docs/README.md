# Nevo Frontend — Docs

Tracked, shareable project documentation. Everything in this folder is committed
to the repo, so the whole team (and CI) works from the same reference.

> **Source specifications are local-only.** The authoritative specs — Complete
> Product Architecture, Frontend Architecture, UI/UX Specification, and the Nevo
> Design System — are distributed as PDFs and contain commercially sensitive
> material (pricing, partners, go-to-market). They live in `context/`, which is
> **gitignored**, and are deliberately not committed. This folder holds the
> non-sensitive, buildable distillations of those specs.

## Contents

- **[architecture.md](./architecture.md)** — Frontend architecture reference:
  stack, project structure, route tree, component organization, hooks, API
  client, state management, design tokens, and auth. The practical "how this
  codebase is organized and why" document, including the key decisions made
  along the way.

### Ticket status

- **[onboarding-ticket-status.md](./onboarding-ticket-status.md)** — B.2
  onboarding: clause-by-clause coverage. Frontend-complete; only backend-blocked
  gaps remain.
- **[lesson-player-ticket-status.md](./lesson-player-ticket-status.md)** — B.7
  lesson player: coverage across Slices 0–6, remaining frontend work, and the
  backend-blocked adaptation spine.
- **[blocked-items-handoff.md](./blocked-items-handoff.md)** — consolidated
  design decisions + backend contracts outstanding across both tickets, for
  handoff to Design & Backend.

### Planning

- **[student-daily-experience-epic.md](./student-daily-experience-epic.md)** —
  the "student daily experience" ticket (B.4–B.11) split into buildable per-screen
  stories, with scope decisions and data dependencies flagged.

## Conventions

- Docs are Markdown and kept in sync with the code as it evolves.
- Commercially sensitive material never goes here — it stays in `context/`.
- Git workflow rules live in `context/git-guidelines.md` (local-only for now).
