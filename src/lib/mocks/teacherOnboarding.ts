/**
 * Teacher onboarding fixture (C01). The invite arrives pre-filled from the
 * school's setup; the teacher only confirms and adds a light profile. The
 * name lines up with the console fixture teacher (Adunni "Ms." Adeyemi) and
 * the class list is the real TEACHER_CLASSES fixture, exactly as the frame's
 * own mock data has it.
 *
 * IT HAS BEEN REPLACED (verified 11 Sep 2026). `SetPasswordForm.tsx:224`
 * calls `invitesApi.acceptJoin(token, { password })`, so the simulated verify
 * round-trip this comment used to describe is gone, and the two timing
 * constants that drove it went with it - nothing in `src/` referenced them.
 *
 * `TEACHER_INVITE` IS GONE (16 Sep). Its last reader was the SSO callback's
 * "Signing you in through {school}", which meant a teacher of any school was
 * told they were being signed in through Corona Secondary School. The callback
 * now says "your school", so nothing consumes this fixture.
 *
 * It is deleted rather than left unused on purpose: a fixture identity sitting
 * next to an auth screen is how the last two of these happened. The activate
 * page had already refused it for the same reason - see the comment at
 * `app/auth/teacher/activate/page.tsx:13`.
 *
 * If a screen ever needs the real school name, it comes from `users/me` after
 * sign-in, or from a pre-auth lookup that does not exist yet. Not from here.
