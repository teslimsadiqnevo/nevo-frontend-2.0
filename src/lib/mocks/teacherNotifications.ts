/**
 * Notifications mock (C13). Time-relevant events, never disruptive - each

 * soft tint rather than bold shouting.
 *
 * Superseded for a signed-in teacher: the bell runs on `/api/notifications`.
 * These back the signed-out designed panel only - a failed feed shows nothing
 * rather than these, because each line names a real child.
