/**
 * THE COPY SWEEP, MADE MECHANICAL.
 *
 * Design ran the child-labelling sweep across the design repo on 17 Sep and
 * reported the modality-copy family fixed at its sources. It was - in the
 * frames. Code carries its own copies of the same strings, so the signed-out
 * console went on saying that Chisom "keeps doing better when a lesson leads
 * with audio", that a stall was "really not like him", and that Amara "tends
 * to settle faster when she can hear it first", for as long as nobody looked.
 * The audit covered what the product was designed to say and not what it
 * actually says, which is the half that ships.
 *
 * THE RULE, as it now stands at the top of the copy audit: copy about a child
 * may say what Nevo did. It may never say what the child is, prefers, tends
 * to do, is better at, struggles with, or responds well to. No confidence
 * level, certainty rating or strength indicator may be attached to any
 * statement about a child.
 *
 * This file is that rule over every teacher fixture a signed-out visitor can
 * read - the only surface where being wrong costs us in public.
 * `teacherStudents.test.ts` next door does the same job for the profile and
 * its sanctioned observations; the two are separate files because they guard
 * different vocabularies.
 *
 * IT WALKS VALUES, NOT SOURCE, for two reasons. A grep over the source would
 * trip on the comments that record what was removed - and it would miss the
 * copy that is not exported at all. `INSIGHTS` is a module-private const
 * reachable only through `getClassInsights`, and the first version of this
 * file did not cover a word of it: a mutation run put "uncharacteristic" back
 * into a flag note and every test still passed. The accessors are called
 * below for exactly that reason.
