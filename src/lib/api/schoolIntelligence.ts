 * count them.
 *
 * CAUTION: `term` is the matched text. On a scan for diagnostic labels that
 * is likely to BE a diagnostic label, which is the one category of string
 * this product may never put on screen. Nothing renders a finding's contents
 * today, and nothing should start without design ruling on `term` first.

/**
 * A finding, with the two fields counsel forbade REMOVED AT THE BOUNDARY.
 *
 * Counsel cleared this screen on 14 Sep with four rules. Two of them are
 * subtractive: never show the flagged `term`, and never show the `recordId`,
 * which ties a finding to an identifiable child. The wire carries both - all
 * four fields are required on `ComplianceFindingResponse` - so they are
 * stripped in `stripFinding` below rather than merely left unrendered.
 *
 * WHY STRIP RATHER THAN DECLINE TO RENDER. A field that is in React state is
 * one `{JSON.stringify(finding)}` away from a screen, one debug log away from
 * a console, and one props-spread away from an attribute. The rule is easier
 * to keep if the data is not there. This type is what the rest of the console
 * is allowed to know a finding is.
