/**
 * Intelligence Framework endpoints (FE Architecture §1 & §4): learner profile,
 * lesson adaptation, attention flags, and recommendations.
 *
 * A flag names a student by id and describes what Nevo noticed, in the same
 * plain register the console writes in.
 *
 * This file used to say a flag carried no evidence series and no action
 * target, and that the C03 card's sparkline and its two links therefore had no
 * source. Backend has since added `evidenceSeries` and `actionTargets`, so
 * both are typed below and both are optional - an older row may still arrive
 * without them. The correction is left visible rather than quietly swapped in.
 *
 * `flagType` still has no enum, so anything unrecognised must still render.
 *
 * Zero-Tag holds here: `description` is about behaviour in the moment, never a
 * diagnosis. Nothing on this route may be rendered as a label about a child.
 *
 * TODO: type `getProfile`, `getAdaptation` and `getRecommendations` too.
