/**
 * Teacher-to-SENCo escalations - a teacher raising a concern about a child
 * with the person whose job it is to act on it.
 *
 * This transport did not exist until 15 Sep 2026. Before it, `ShareSheet`
 * carried a disabled button and said so, because the alternatives all lied:
 * `POST /api/messages` constrains `recipientType` to `student|class`, the IEP
 * share takes a `parentId`, and the flags read is GET-only. A safeguarding
 * disclosure reported as delivered when nothing left the browser is the worst
 * defect this console could carry, so the claim was removed and the reason
 * left in its place. `POST /api/v1/escalations` is that reason expiring.
 *
 * THE RECENT PICTURE IS NOT SENT. `recentPicture` is on the RESPONSE, derived
 * server-side from the student record - the client neither builds it nor
 * uploads it. That matters for the sheet's copy: "a note goes to your SENCo
 * along with their recent picture" is a promise the server keeps, so it can
 * stay. Do not assemble a summary here and post it; it would be a second,
 * divergent account of the same child.
 *
 * `GET` is the SENCo/admin view. It is typed here because the escalation is
 * one object with two readers, and the admin console will want this exact
 * shape - but nothing in the teacher console calls it. A teacher's own
 * "already shared" state is deliberately NOT read back from it: whether a
 * teacher may list escalations at all is untested, and a 403 rendered as
 * "not shared yet" would be a worse answer than showing nothing.

   * `GET /api/intelligence/flags` is already read by `useTeacherFlags`, so a
   * flag id is obtainable. C.8b simply never asks the teacher which flag they
   * mean; it asks "What are you noticing?" and takes prose. Attaching a flag
   * the teacher did not choose would tell the SENCo this escalation is about
   * that concern when the teacher may have meant another, or none. Offering
   * the choice is a design question, flagged rather than guessed.
