/**
 * Every adaptation in a window, tallied per learner — or nothing at all.
 *
 * D8b puts "adaptations this week" on each learner's row. A marker in SencoView
 * once deferred it as needing a request per learner; a later correction said it
 * was "one windowed call". BOTH WERE WRONG, and the second one more dangerously:
 *
 *   - `GET /api/admin/adaptation-log` caps `limit` at 100. A school's week does
 *     not fit in one page.
 *   - `AdaptationEventLogResponse.total` carries NO DESCRIPTION in the deployed
 *     spec. Required is not the same as window-scoped or uncapped, so a
 *     completeness check resting on `total` could be comparing against a number
 *     that means something else entirely — and every per-learner tally would be
 *     quietly low.
 *
 * SO TERMINATION IS ON A SHORT PAGE, and `total` IS NOT CONSULTED AT ALL.
 * `events.length < limit` is the only exhaustion signal this contract supports.
 *
 * An earlier draft used `total` as a corroborating gate - report nothing if it
 * claims more than we read. That is worse than no gate. If `total` turns out to
 * count the whole log rather than the window it disagrees on every school on
 * every load, so the figure would be blank everywhere, permanently and
 * silently, for a reason nobody would find. A normal concurrent write during
 * paging tripped it too. A field with undocumented semantics cannot be the
 * thing that decides whether a screen speaks.
 *
 * PARTIAL IS REPORTED AS NOTHING. A tally built from the pages we managed to
 * read is a FLOOR, and a floor rendered beside a child's name as a count is the
 * under-report this console has shipped before. `complete: false` means the
 * caller shows no figures at all.
