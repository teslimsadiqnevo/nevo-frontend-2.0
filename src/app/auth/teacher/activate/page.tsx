/**
 * C02c Teacher Activation - opened from the invite link the admin sent.
 * Clicking that link IS the verification; the teacher only sets a password.
 *
 * NO FIXTURE IDENTITY. This page used to pass `TEACHER_INVITE.email` and
 * `TEACHER_INVITE.school` as the activating teacher's own details, and the
 * form treats the prop as the fallback when the link carries no `?email=`.
 * So a real invitee could be shown `a.adeyemi@coronaschools.edu.ng` and a
 * school they have never heard of as their own - and the post-activation
 * sign-in would then be attempted against that address.
 *
 * The link is the only thing that knows who is activating. If it does not say,
 * the screen does not guess.
