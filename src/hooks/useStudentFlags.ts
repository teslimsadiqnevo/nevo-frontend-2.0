/**
 * What Nevo has noticed about ONE child - C08's noticing banner.
 *
 * `GET /api/intelligence/flags?studentId=` has taken the parameter all along;
 * the profile said the banner was absent "for want of an endpoint" and that
 * was wrong. `description` is REQUIRED on `AttentionFlagResponse`, so a flag
 * that exists always carries the sentence the banner is made of, and there is
 * no case where a flag arrives with nothing to render.
 *
 * `flagType` IS NOT CARRIED. The teacher dashboard uses it for an accent, and
 * "engagement decline" beside a named child is the diagnostic register rule 2
 * forbids - the description is what Nevo saw, which is the whole substance.
 *
 * ACKNOWLEDGED FLAGS ARE DROPPED, the same rule "Worth your attention" on the
 * dashboard follows: the banner is what still wants the teacher, not a
 * history. Nothing here acknowledges anything - design ruled (2 Sep) that the
 * tap on the dashboard card is the acknowledgement, and opening a profile is
 * not that tap.
 *
 * NO WINDOW IS CLAIMED. The frame labels this "This week:" and the contract
 * cannot support it: a flag carries `generatedAt`, the route declares no
 * window, and deciding "this week" from a date is the threshold frontend §6
 * rules out. Each line carries its own date instead, the way this screen
 * already dates adaptations and sessions.
