/**
 * The teacher's class list, live-first: GET /api/v1/teachers/me/classes when
 * a session exists, the design fixtures otherwise.
 *
 * NO NAME MATCHING. This hook used to pair a live class with a fixture of the
 * same name and hand back the fixture - roster, lessons, observations and all -
 * with only the join code replaced. That was defensible while no roster
 * endpoint existed and indefensible the moment one did: the demo school's real
 * class is called "JSS 2A", which is also a fixture name, so a real teacher
 * opening their own class was shown six invented children, complete with seat
 * numbers, as though they were their students.
 *
 * So a live class is now only ever itself. Fixtures back the designed screens
 * when there is no live data at all, and never stand in for a real class.
 *
 * A response always wins, however late - see `useLiveQuery`. Only a genuine
 * failure raises `sample`, which is the one honest reason to put fixtures on
 * screen.
