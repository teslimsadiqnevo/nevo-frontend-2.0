/**
 * Current admin's permission scopes - Admin Layer only (FE Architecture §8).
 *
 * WHY THIS RE-ASKS. The provider used to run its effect once, on `[]`, and
 * swallow every failure into an empty scope list. Two things a real admin hits
 * on day one came out of that:
 *
 * 1. The onboarding wizard mounts the admin layout BEFORE a session exists, so
 *    the first run finds no token, resolves with no scopes, and never asks
 *    again. When the founding admin finishes and clicks through to their
 *    dashboard - a soft navigation, same provider still mounted - the rail
 *    shows a single row and the words "No access yet". Their first sight of
 *    the console says they do not have one.
 * 2. A 500, or the API proxy's 60-second cold-start 502, produced exactly the
 *    same state: an empty rail, no error, no retry, and only a full reload
 *    could recover.
 *
 * So the distinction this file now keeps is between an ANSWER and an ABSENCE.
 * `ready` means the backend told us the scopes - including telling us there
 * are none, which is a real answer and is left alone. `skipped` and `failed`
 * are not answers, and are re-asked.
 *
 * WHEN IT RE-ASKS. On the pathname changing, which is what a soft navigation
 * inside the admin layout gives us, and on `refresh()` for an explicit retry.
 * Same-tab sign-in cannot be observed any other way: the token lives in
 * localStorage and the `storage` event only fires in OTHER tabs, so the
 * session store has nothing to notify us with. Re-asking is cheap and guarded
 * - once a real answer is in, navigation does not refetch.
