/**
 * The parent data-rights page (SCRUM-80, D01c).
 *
 * Tested more carefully than a screen of its size would normally warrant,
 * because the thing it does is statutory. NDPA 2023 s.31 requires a parent to
 * have a direct route to review, object and withdraw; if a button here says a
 * right was exercised and no request left the browser, Nevo has told a parent
 * something untrue about their child on a page whose entire purpose is to be
 * trustworthy.
 *
 * So the assertions are mostly about the WIRE: that the right value goes out,
 * that a failure is never dressed as a success, and that withdrawal - the one
 * irreversible action - cannot happen on a single tap.
 *
 * The invitation is a PROP now, read once by `ParentPortal`, so the tests that
 * used to cover fetching (loading, unknown token) live in that file instead.
