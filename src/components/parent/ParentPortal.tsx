/**
 * The whole parent surface behind one tokenised link (SCRUM-80).
 *
 * A parent gets ONE link and taps it whenever they think of it - before
 * deciding, right after deciding, or six weeks later. So the route does not
 * decide what to show; the record does:
 *
 *   not_sent / pending  -> D01b, the consent request
 *   confirmed           -> D01c, data management
 *   withdrawn           -> D01c, which opens in its suspended state
 *
 * Backend made this possible on purpose: an already-decided link still
 * resolves rather than 404ing, precisely so "a parent who already decided
 * lands on the state of that decision, not on the question again". Asking a
 * parent to consent to something they already consented to - or worse,
 * something they already withdrew - would be the single worst bug this
 * surface could have.
 *
 * The read happens HERE and once. Both screens take the invitation as a prop
 * rather than fetching their own, so there is one request, one loading state,
 * and no window where the two disagree about the same record.
