/**
 * The one tokenised link, and which screen it opens.
 *
 * A parent gets a single link and taps it whenever they think of it. The route
 * does not decide what to show - the record does. The failure this file exists
 * to prevent is asking a parent to consent to something they have already
 * consented to, or worse, already withdrawn.
 *
 * These render the REAL D01b and D01c beneath the portal rather than stubs, so
 * a wrong branch shows up as the wrong screen rather than as a passing test
 * against a mock that cannot be wrong.
