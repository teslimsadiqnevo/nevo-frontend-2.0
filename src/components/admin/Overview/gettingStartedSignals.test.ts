/**
 * The last two getting-started rows that could never tick.
 *
 * Three of five were signal-backed; "Choose how everyone signs in" and "Send
 * parent consent requests" rendered an OPEN circle for every school for ever —
 * including a school that had connected Microsoft and sent every request it
 * owed. An open circle here reads as "you have not done this", so the screen
 * was telling finished schools they were unfinished.
 *
 * Both predicates follow `teachersOnRoster`'s discipline, and that discipline
 * is the thing under test: a tick is a POSITIVE CLAIM about this school, so
 * unknown must never tick, and nothing may be inferred from an absence.
