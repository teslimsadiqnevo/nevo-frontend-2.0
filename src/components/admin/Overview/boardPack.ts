/**
 * "Copy for board pack" - D04's one export, as plain text.
 *
 * SCRUM-39 fixes both the label swap ("Copy for board pack" -> "Copied for
 * board pack") and what goes in it: "The copied text includes the compliance
 * line and the adaptation count, since both are the board-facing points." The
 * frame's own handler copies the narrative paragraph alone, which predates the
 * compliance card; the spec is the later word and wins.
 *
 * THE COMPLIANCE SENTENCE IS NOT RE-WORDED HERE. It comes from `labelHero`,
 * the same function the card on screen reads, because this text is pasted into
 * a governors' pack and read aloud - a second copy of that claim is exactly how
 * the pack and the screen end up asserting different things about the same
 * count. `ndpaClaims.ts` exists because that had already happened once.
 *
 * NOTHING IS COPIED THAT WAS NOT ON SCREEN. No scores, no per-student
 * anything, no figure the admin could not see above the button - the footer
 * line beside this action promises a governor exactly that.
 *
 * A FIGURE WE DO NOT HAVE IS OMITTED, NEVER ZEROED. A failed audit read costs
 * the pack its compliance paragraph; it must not put "Diagnostic labels
 * stored: 0" into a board document on the strength of a read that did not
 * return.
