/**
 * Sign-out confirm for the admin console (SCRUM-39: sidebar footer, a calm
 * confirm overlay, never an immediate logout).
 *
 * The admin console shipped without any way to end a session. The Bearer token
 * is mirrored to localStorage and survives a tab close until the backend's
 * `expires_at`, so on a shared school machine the next person to open the
 * browser was signed in as the proprietor. Waiting for expiry or clearing site
 * data were the only exits.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the same thing as D12c's "Sign out everywhere else": that
 * acts on OTHER sessions and per SCRUM-99 never signs out the current device.
 * This is the current device, and it is the only control that ends this session.
 *
 * Two details are load-bearing and copied from the teacher console's modal
 * rather than reinvented:
 *
 * 1. It goes through `AuthContext.signOut`, not `authApi.logout`. The context
 *    revokes server-side, clears the local session AND purges the on-device
 *    behavioural-signal store (NDPA ephemerality, SCRUM-76). Calling logout()
 *    alone leaves the in-memory user and that store behind.
 * 2. The navigation is HARD (`window.location.assign`), not `router.push`. The
 *    route guard in `proxy.ts` reads the `nevo.role` cookie, and a client-side
 *    push races the clearing of it - the guard still sees an admin, bounces you
 *    off the door back into the console, and the token then drops underneath
 *    you. Signing out lands you where you started and logs you out a moment
 *    later.
 *
 * Admins land on their own door, `/auth/admin`, not the teacher one.
