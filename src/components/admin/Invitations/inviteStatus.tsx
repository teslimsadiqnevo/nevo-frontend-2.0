 * D19's status vocabulary, and the frame states the palette outright:

 * near-black for expired; failures follow gentle recovery, never red."
 *
 * An expired invite is not an error and a revoked one is not a failure - both
 * are ordinary administrative facts, and neither gets an alarm colour.
 *
 * TODO(api): `status` is typed `string|null` with no enum. "pending",
 * "joined", "expired" and "revoked" are the values D19 draws; anything else
 * falls through to a neutral pill showing the backend's own word rather than
 * being forced into one of ours.
