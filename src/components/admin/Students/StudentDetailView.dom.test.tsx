/**
 * A guardian read that FAILED must not render as a child with no guardian.
 *
 * This screen's own docblock says it is written to be shown TO A PARENT, and
 * the card states real absences in almost identical words - "No guardian on the
 * record. A parent account is created automatically once a guardian confirms
 * consent." A 500 used to produce that sentence about a child whose guardian is
 * on file, and nobody reading it could tell.
 *
 * It is the shape PR #218 fixed once on the SENCo profile and #269 fixed in
 * five more places. Those five shipped WITHOUT tests on a belief that a mocked
 * rejection could not be tested here. That belief was wrong - this file is the
 * proof - so the guards are being pinned retrospectively.
