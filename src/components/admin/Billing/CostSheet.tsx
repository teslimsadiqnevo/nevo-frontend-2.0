/**
 * D11's cost sheet - what the school pays, and how it is arrived at.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * IT USED TO COMPUTE THIS ITSELF, FROM A SHAPE THE API HAD STOPPED SERVING.
 *
 * Two separate faults, and the first hid the second for a week.
 *
 * The read was flat - `subscription.activeStudentCount`,
 * `subscription.perStudentAnnualRate`, `subscription.currency`. The deployed
 * contract has none of those names: they live under `pricing`, as
 * `studentCount` and `perStudentRate`. So every one of them was `undefined`,
 * `computeCost` returned null, and EVERY school was shown "your per-student
 * rate isn't set yet" - a false statement about their contract, on the screen
 * that exists to tell them what they pay.
 *
 * And underneath it, the arithmetic itself should not have been here. The
 * backend sends `totalBeforeVat`, `vatRate`, `vatAmount` and `totalWithVat`,
 * computed against the school's actual contract. This file derived them in
 * integer minor units from a hard-coded Nigerian 7.5% gated on `currency ===
 * "NGN"` - careful work against the wrong authority. A VAT-exempt school, a
 * grandfathered rate, or a rate change and the console disagrees with the
 * invoice the school is actually sent.
 *
 * So: NO ARITHMETIC IN THIS FILE. Every figure below is a string the server
 * computed, formatted and shown. The only thing this component decides is
 * wording.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The VAT RATE is deliberately not printed. The contract types it as `string`,
 * and "7.5" and "0.075" are the same rate a hundredfold apart on screen - see
 * the TODO(api) on `Pricing`. The AMOUNT is unambiguous, and the amount is what
 * a school pays.
