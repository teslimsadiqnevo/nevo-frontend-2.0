/**
 * 28c-1 — "Who's learning?"
 *
 * The screen that replaces the single-identity lock screen. What it is allowed
 * to say is the interesting part: this is a pre-authentication screen in a room
 * full of other people's children, so the frame permits "first names and
 * avatars only, nowhere a username, surname, class, school code or last-used
 * time".
 *
 * That rule is enforced in `deviceRoster` rather than here - a `PickerEntry`
 * structurally cannot carry a credential - so these cover what this component
 * adds on top: that a nameless child is still reachable, that the shape is
 * decorative rather than an identity, and that choosing reports an opaque id.
