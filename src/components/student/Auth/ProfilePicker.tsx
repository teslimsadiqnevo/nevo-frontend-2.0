/**
 * 28c-1 — "Who's learning?": the children this tablet remembers.
 *
 * Replaces the single-identity lock screen, which kept the last child's name on
 * an unauthenticated screen and gave the child before them no way back to their
 * own account except a second one.
 *
 * WHAT IS ON SCREEN IS FIRST NAMES AND SHAPES. The frame: *"First names and
 * avatars only, nowhere a username, surname, class, school code or last-used
 * time."* That is enforced upstream rather than here - this component is handed
 * `PickerEntry`, which structurally cannot carry a credential, so no future
 * edit to this file can put one on screen. See `deviceRoster`.
 *
 * A TILE WITH NO NAME IS EXPECTED (28c-4). A PIN login returns a session, not a
 * profile, so a child can be remembered before we ever learn their name. The
 * shape stands alone rather than inventing a name or falling back to their
 * username, which is what the old lock screen did.
 *
 * Portrait and landscape both, because a tray-mounted tablet cannot be turned -
 * the same reason the rotate prompt has a way through.

        LANDSCAPE SIDE PADDING IS 40px, NOT THE FRAME'S 64px, and the frame is
        why. Its landscape grid declares `max-width:960px` with 142px tiles and
        16px gaps - six of those need 932px - while its 64px padding leaves only
        896px on a 1024-wide tablet. The two disagree, so the frame's own
        layout would wrap six children to five and one: a single lone tile on a
        second row, which is the worst arrangement for a child scanning for
        their own face. Following the declared grid rather than the padding
        keeps them on one row. Raised with design.
