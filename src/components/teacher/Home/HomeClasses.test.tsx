/**
 * Home's class trio, and the clearest example in the console of the failure
 * mode this codebase cares most about: FAILURE MUST NEVER RENDER AS ABSENCE -
 * and, worse here, must never render as SOMEONE ELSE'S DATA.
 *
 * The defect this pins down already shipped. `useTeacherClasses` returns
 * fixtures when `data === null`, which covers "not back yet" AND "never
 * coming", and this component read neither flag - so for the whole in-flight
 * window, which the backend's own 1.0-5.6s latency makes seconds long on
 * every single load, a signed-in teacher was shown JSS 2A, JSS 2B and SSS 1
 * Sciences with invented headcounts. Classes that were not theirs, presented
 * as theirs.
 *
 * The hook is mocked rather than the network. `useLiveQuery` is tested
 * directly elsewhere; what matters HERE is that the component reads the flags
 * the hook publishes, which is exactly what it failed to do.
