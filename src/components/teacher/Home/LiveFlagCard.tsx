/**
 * One live "Worth your attention" card.
 *
 * C03's card pairs the note with a five-bar evidence sparkline, a caption
 * under it, and two actions. The flag endpoint carries none of that - no
 * series, no target - so this card keeps what is real: the accent, who it is
 * about, what Nevo noticed, when, and the one action that works.
 *
 * THE CARD IS THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. Design ruled on 2 Sep that a teacher never
 * sees an acknowledge button: tapping the card opens the student's profile and
 * marks the flag seen in the same action. So the tap fires
 * `POST /api/intelligence/flags/{id}/acknowledge` and navigates, and
 * `useTeacherFlags` already filters acknowledged flags out - which is what
 * makes the flag stop asking.
 *
 * The write is deliberately not awaited and its failure is deliberately
 * silent. There is no UI for an outcome the teacher was never told about, and
 * blocking navigation on a background write would make a tap feel broken. A
 * failed acknowledge simply leaves the flag where it was, to be shown again -
 * which is the safe direction to fail in.
 *
 * An earlier note here said the profile could not be linked because
 * `/teacher/students/{id}` resolved against fixtures and would 404 on a real
 * id. That is no longer true: `StudentRoute` resolves live first and falls
 * back to a fixture only when the live read fails.
