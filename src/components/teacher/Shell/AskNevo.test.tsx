/**
 * Ask Nevo's conversation history (C15), and the thread-id bug underneath it.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. The drawer minted its own thread id -
 * `useRef(randomId())` - and sent it as `contextIds.threadId` on every turn.
 * `randomId` returns a real v4 UUID, so `asUuid` waved it through and no
 * request ever failed: the defect was completely silent. But the server issues
 * its OWN thread id and returns it on `AskResponse.threadId`, which this client
 * did not even have a field for. So every turn claimed to continue a
 * conversation the backend had never heard of, and the history list added here
 * could never have matched a stored thread back to the drawer that made it.
 *
 * The assertion is therefore about the REQUEST, not the rendering: a first turn
 * must carry no thread, and a second turn must carry the one the server sent
 * back. Asserting on what appears on screen would pass against the bug, because
 * the bug never changed what the teacher saw.
 *
 * The rest is history honesty. There is no fixture history in this repo and
 * there must never be one: elsewhere a failed read may show a designed screen
 * behind `data-nevo-sample`, because a fixture class is recognisably not yours.
 * A fixture CONVERSATION is not - it is words put in the teacher's mouth and in
 * Nevo's. So loading, empty and failed are three distinct states here and none
 * of them may borrow another's copy.
