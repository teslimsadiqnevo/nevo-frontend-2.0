/**
 * C02b, the screen a teacher lands on coming back from their school's identity
 * provider.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. The signing-in line read
 * `Signing you in through ${TEACHER_INVITE.school}`, a fixture, so a teacher of
 * any school was told they were being signed in through Corona Secondary
 * School - on an auth screen, mid-handshake, at the moment they are deciding
 * whether to trust what they are looking at.
 *
 * Nothing on this screen knows the school: the teacher arrives BEFORE the token
 * exchange, so there is no session to read one off, and the callback carries a
 * provider and a code rather than a school name.
 *
 * NOTE FOR WHOEVER EDITS THESE. `shown` is `incomplete ? "error" : phase`, and
 * `incomplete` is true unless provider, code AND state are all on the URL. A
 * render with no search params shows the ERROR phase, so a "no school name
 * appears" assertion written that way passes without ever rendering the line it
 * claims to check. The first draft of this file did exactly that. `signingIn()`
 * below is what puts the screen on the phase under test.
